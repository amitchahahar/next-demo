							information retention period as
							outlined in section 6 or achievement of
							the purpose of processing as outlined
							in section 4 above.
						</p>
						<p className='privacy-policy-paragraph-link'>
							If the personal information retention
							period agreed by the user has lapsed or
							the personal information needs to be
							kept in accordance with other laws
							despite the achievement of the purpose
							of processing, the personal information
							may be moved to a separate database
							(DB) or stored to be preserved
							differently. Separately stored personal

							<strong>
								7.3.1. Destruction Procedure

							<strong>
								8. Personal Data Transferred

						</p>
						<h3 className='privacy-policy-subheading'>
							<strong>9. Data Security</strong>

						<p className='privacy-policy-paragraph-link'>
							Categories of Personal Information
							Collected, Used, and Disclosed
						</p>
						<p className='privacy-policy-paragraph-link'>
							“Personal Information” is information
							that identifies, relates to, describes,
							is reasonably capable of being
							associated with, or could reasonably be
							linked, directly or indirectly, with a
							particular consumer or household. In
							accordance with California law, we
							collected the following categories of
							Personal Information within the
							preceding 12 months:
						</p>
						<p className='privacy-policy-paragraph-link'>
							Identifiers such as your name, alias,
							email address, mailing address, IP
							address, and online identifiers;

						<p className='privacy-policy-paragraph-link'>
							Internet or other electronic network
							activity information, including
							information on your usage of our
							Website (“Usage Information”);

							We disclose each of these categories of
							Personal Information to our service
							providers to the extent necessary for
							them to facilitate our business
							purposes (including any purpose
							specified in Section 4, above).
							Additionally, within the past 12
							months, some of our online advertisers
							may have used and disclosed Usage
							Information collected automatically
							from the Service. This may be a “sale”
							as broadly defined under the CCPA.
							Therefore, we provide you the right to
							opt out of this “sale” of Personal
							Information as described, below.

							specific pieces of Personal Information
							we have collected about you, and the
							business purposes for which such
							personal information is collected and
							shared. You also have the right to
							request information on the categories

							improve their interest-based
							advertising networks.

						<p className='privacy-policy-paragraph-link'>
							Regardless of whether this is a “sale,”
